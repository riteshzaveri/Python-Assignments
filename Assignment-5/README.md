## Task 1: Student Marks Lookup

This program allows the user to input a student's name and retrieves the corresponding marks from a predefined dictionary.

### Functionality:

- Creates a dictionary of student names and their marks.
- Prompts the user to enter a student's name.

## Task 2: List Slicing and Reversing

This program demonstrates list slicing by extracting and reversing the first five elements of a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

### Functionality:

- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements using slicing.
- Reverses the extracted elements using the `reverse()` method.
- Prints both the original extracted list and the reversed list.

### Sample Output:

```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
