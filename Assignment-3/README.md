## Task 1: Factorial of a Number

This program defines a function to compute the factorial of a given number using a `for` loop and then calls that function with a sample input.

### Functionality:

- Defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number using iteration.
- Calls the function with a sample number.
- Displays the calculated factorial.

### Sample Output:

```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Task 2: Mathematical Operations using math Module

This program takes a number from the user and uses the `math` module to calculate the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the number.

### Functionality:

- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Uses the `math` module to compute:
  - Square root
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)
  - Sine (in radians)
- Displays the results.

### Sample Output:

```
Enter a number: 25
Square Root: 5.0
Natural Logarithm (base e): 3.2188758248682006
Sine (in radians): -0.13235175009777303
```

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Run the script using your terminal or Python IDE.
