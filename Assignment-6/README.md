## Assignment 6: Calculator GUI Application

This project creates a simple calculator using Python's built-in `tkinter` library.

### Functionality:

- A graphical user interface with buttons for digits (0–9), operations (+, −, ×, /), and clear functionality.
- A display area (entry box) to show the input expression and the result.
- Performs basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Uses custom logic to evaluate the mathematical expression.

### Sample Features:

- Clear button to reset the input.
- `=` button to evaluate the result.
- Buttons are responsive and neatly arranged using place().

## Set Up a Virtual Environment (Python 3.9.18)

To ensure consistency across environments, it's recommended to use a virtual environment with Python 3.9.18.

### Steps:

1. **Install Python 3.9.18 (if not already installed)**  
   You can use `pyenv`, direct installer, or your OS package manager.

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3.9 -m venv venv

3. **Activate the virtual environment**      
   source venv/bin/activate [On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate]

4. **Run the calculator script**
